	<p> There have 17 households and we live happily together by assisting each other. And one thing between villagers, that they are not the same according to religious and ethnicity. But we are ok to live each other. And also we celebrate the festivals depend on religious and the neighbor assist to finish the festival. Even we live different people; we love and care each other of being and belief without discrimination. Without diversity neighbour, my family will not be happy, will not have a happy home because we cannot live without having neighbour and the different is a part of my family.       </p>
